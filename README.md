# AccountingWarehouse
Accounting Warehouse is a web application almost entirely developed in PHP and uses MySQL for the DBMS. This project is supposed to be a web-based accounting software that is able to handle journalizing, preparation of financial reports, chart of accounts and ratio analysis. 
The project is currently hosted on namecheap servers at this link: theaccountingwarehouse.xyz. However, if you want to run it on your localhost, you can set up either LAMP stack or simply use XAMPP server.
